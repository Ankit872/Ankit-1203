ANSWER 2
use db;


 create table std_info(
 Roll_no int(10) primary key,
 Name varchar(30) not null,
 dob date,
 Address varchar(50),
 Marks int(3),
 Phone_number varchar(10));


 create table Paper_details(
 Paper_code int(10) primary key,
 Paper_name varchar(20));


 create table Academic_details(
 Roll_no int(10),
 Paper_code int(10) not null,
 Attendance int(10) not null,
 homeexam_marks int(3)
 primary key(Roll_no,Paper_code));




(a) Roll_no is the primary key for the table std_info, Paper_code is the primary key of table Paper_details and Roll_no,Paper_code is the primary key of table Academic_details.
Academic_details have two foreign keys viz. Roll_no and Paper_code.
